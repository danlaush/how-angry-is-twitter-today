# How Angry Is Twitter Today

Goal: Build an applet that shows the user how "angry" a given section of Twitter is at the moment

Sentiment analysis is interesting to me linguistically but the data science required is over my head at the moment.

## TODO

- [x] Build layout
- [ ] Rebuild in frontend framework
    - [ ] Set background colour on form submission
    - [ ] Set input size based on current text
- [ ] Learn python?
- [ ] Analyse some sentiment lol
